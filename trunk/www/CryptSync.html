			CryptSync is a small utility that synchronizes two folders
			while encrypting the contents in one folder. That means one
			of the two folders has all files unencrypted (the files
			you work with) and the other folder has all the files
			encrypted.
			<br />
			The synchronization works both ways: a change in one folder
			gets synchronized to the other folder. If a file is added
			or modified in the unencrypted folder, it gets encrypted.
			If a file is added or modified in the encrypted folder, it
			get decrypted to the other folder.
			</p>
			<p>

			</p>
			<p>
			This is best used together with cloud storage tools like
			<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/">SkyDrive</a>,
			<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">DropBox</a> or <a href="https://drive.google.com/">GDrive</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
			If you want to use such cloud storage for backups, it's a good
			idea to keep your private data really private. That means
			only uploading encrypted files to make sure noone else
			can access your data. Because even if the companies behind
			the cloud storage guarantee your privacy, it's always
			possible that your account gets hacked: so make sure you
			use a different password to encrypt the data with CryptSync
			than you use to login to your cloud storage provider!
			</p>
			<p>
			If you want to backup and encrypt your files to more than
			one cloud storage (just to be safe), you can do that as well:
			just set up two sync pairs with the original folder being
			the same for both pairs.
			</p>
			<p>
			CryptSync works by synchronizing folder pairs. One folder
			is called the <code>original</code> folder: that's where
			your unencrypted files are stored and where you work
			with your files. The second folder of such a pair is the
			<code>encrypted</code> folder which is where the files
			get copied from the original folder and encrypted.
			The encrypted folder is usually located somewhere inside
			your cloud storage sync folder.
			</p>
			<p>
			The encryption is done using <a href="http://7-zip.org/">7-zip</a>,
			which also compress them at the same time. That means you
			not only get encryption but also compression for free,
			which reduces the storage space you use in the cloud.
			<br />
			That also means that if you ever need to access your encrypted
			files directly from the cloud, you can save them locally
			and just open them with 7-zip or other compression tools.
			Of course you're then asked to provide the password you used
			with CryptSync to open that file.
			</p>
			<p>
			When you first start CryptSync, the main dialog is shown
			where you have to set up the folders to synchronize.
			</p>
			<p>

			</p>
			<p>
			To add a folder pair, click on the button and then enter
			the paths to both folders. Then enter the password that
			will be used to encrypt and decrypt your files.

			</p>
			<p>
			Since even filenames can reveal private information, you can
			have CryptSync also encrypt the filenames. But remember
			that if you activate this option, you won't be able to
			tell what file is what if you ever need to access them
			from your cloud storage providers web interface.
			</p>
			<p>
			The main dialog has three buttons to dismiss it:
			<dl>
			<dt>Run in background</dt>
			<dd>This is the default. CryptSync will run in the background
			and monitor all the folder pairs for changes. Once it
			detects a change, it will automatically synchronize that
			change immediately. This is also the only way to detect
			deletions of files.</dd>
			<dt>Sync files and exit</dt>
			<dd>This will synchronize all folder pairs while showing
			you the progress of the synchronization. Once all folders
			are synchronized and up to date, CryptSync will exit
			and not run in the background.</dd>
			<dt>Exit</dt>
			<dd>Closes the dialog and quits CryptSync. It will not
			keep running in the background.</dd>
			</dl>
