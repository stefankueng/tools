    <p>
        If you use Internet Explorer for browsing the web then you know
        that for some links you add to your favorites, there is an icon
        indicating the webpage. These are called <em>favicons</em>. But after a
        while these icons get replaced in the favorites with the standard
        web icon again because the Microsoft Internet Explorer stores them
        in the web cache which gets cleaned up according to your settings,
        usually after a few weeks.

        It will scan all links you have in your favorites and check if
        the website has a <em>favicon</em>. If it has one, FavIconizer will download
        that icon and adjust the link in the favorites to use that.
        <br>
        After FavIconizer is finished, you have all the <em>favicons</em> back in your favorites.
