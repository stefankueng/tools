        <h2>Microsoft import tool</h2>
        <p>
        Microsoft now has its own tool to import notes from Evernote into
        Onenote. It works similar to Evernote2Onenote.
        You can get Microsofts tool from
        <a href="https://www.onenote.com/import-evernote-to-onenote">https://www.onenote.com/import-evernote-to-onenote</a>

    <p>Evernote2Onenote is a small tool to import
    <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> notebooks to <a href="http://www.onenote.com/">Onenote</a>.
    </p>
    <img src="/img/Evernote2Onenote/Evernote2Onenote-dialog.png" alt="main dialog" width="537" height="180">
    <p>
    Evernote2Onenote requires .NET Framework 4.6. You can get this via Windows
    update or directly from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48130">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="details">Details: how it works</h3>
    <p>
    Evernote2Onenote uses the Evernote script engine <code>ENScript.exe</code>
    to export notes. These notes are parsed and then imported into Onenote.

    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>
    Evernote2Onenote requires that both Evernote and Onenote are installed.
    Also, at least Onenote 2013 or 2016 is required.
    </p>
    <section class="important">
        <h2>Desktop version</h2>
        <p>
            The preinstalled versions of Onenote from the Windows App Store won't work.
            You need the <a href="http://www.onenote.com/">desktop version</a> of Onenote!
        </p>
    </section>

    <h3>How to use</h3>
    <p>
    Start Evernote2Onenote, then select the notebook you want to import into
    Onenote from the combobox. Then click the <code>Start import</code> button
    and wait until the import is finished.
    </p>

    <h3>Command line</h3>
    <p>
    To use Evernote2Onenote from a command line, you can specify the notebook
    to import and the date from which on notes should be imported:
    </p>
<pre>
Evernote2Onenote.exe NotebookName 01-01-2015
</pre>
    <p>If no date is specified, all notes are imported.</p>

    <section class="important">
        <h2>Evernote tags</h2>
        <h3>For Onenote that comes with Office:</h3>
        <p>
            Notes are imported to Onenote in a tab that has the same name as
            the tag the note has. If a note has multiple tags, that note is
            imported multiple times to Onenote, so you get duplicate notes!
        </p>
        <p>
            To avoid duplicate notes, you should first remove duplicate tags
            from your notes in Evernote. The easiest way to do that is to
            create an empty new notebook, export your real notebook in <code>enex</code>
            format and uncheck <code>tags</code> from the export options. Then
            import that enex file into the new notebook. And then of course
            only import that new notebook into Onenote.
        </p>
        <h3>For the free version of Onenote:</h3>
        <p>
            The free version of Onenote has a few restrictions, so all
            notes are imported to the unfiled/quicknotes section.
        </p>
