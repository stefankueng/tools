    <p>
        Sometimes it's necessary to create a lot of test files, or just
        a few but very big ones. Or you need a thousand folders with
        a thousand files in each of them to test with your application.
        FileTool can do that for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Or you need to lock files to test how your application behaves if
        it can not access those files. FileTool can do that for you too.
