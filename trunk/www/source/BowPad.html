    <p>A few notable features of BowPad:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>syntax highlighting for over 100 file types and languages</li>
        <li>handling of many different encodings, including UTF-8, UTF-16 and even UTF-32</li>
        <li>easy ribbon user interface</li>
        <li>navigation hints in the vertical scrollbar</li>
        <li>coloring of open tabs according to their path</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        And before you ask: the name BowPad comes from the fact that it uses
        the ribbon user interface.<br>
        Ribbon &rarr; Bow, Editor &rarr; NotePad = BowPad.<br>
        And of course we all know that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/">Bowties are cool</a>!
