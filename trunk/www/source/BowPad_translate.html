    <p>
        BowPad can show the UI in various languages, but if your language of
        choice is not available, you can help creating it.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Get the required file</h3>
    <p>
        To translate the UI of BowPad into a specific language, you first need
        the file with all the strings you have to translate.
    </p>
    <p>
        The file is stored in our source repository, you can get it from there:
        <a href="https://bowpad.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Languages/BowPad.po">https://bowpad.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Languages/BowPad.po</a>.<br>
        This is the file for the development version, so if you use this to start
        your translation, you will have all the required strings in there.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're starting with your translation, then you first have to rename
        this file to <em>BowPad_XX.po</em> with <em>XX</em> being the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">ISO-639-1 language code</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Start translating</h3>
    <p>
        You could translate the strings with a simple text editor (e.g., BowPad),
        but I recommend a special po-file editor. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.poedit.net/">Poedit</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://virtaal.translatehouse.org/">Virtaal</a></li>
        <li>and many others...</li>
    </ul>
    Now open the po-file in your tool of choice and start translating
    the strings.
    <section class="important">
        <h2>Careful with special chars</h2>
        <p>If you encounter special strings or chars in the original English string,
        make sure you copy that part without changing it. For example tokens like <code>%ld</code>
        are used to format the output. Make sure you keep those <em>as is</em>, otherwise
        you will make BowPad crash when it uses your translated string!</p>
    </section>

    <h3>3. Send the translated file</h3>
    <p>When you finished translating all the strings, attach the file to
    the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/bowpad/issues/detail?id=1">issue number one</a>.
