        <h2 class="title"><a href="#">Auto Aero Colors</a></h2>

        <div class="storycontent">
            <p>Windows 8 (or whatever its name will be when it's released)
            will have a new feature where the Aero colors can be 
            <a href="http://www.withinwindows.com/2011/04/06/windows-8-secrets-aero-auto-colorization/">
            automatically adjusted according to the selected wallpaper</a>.</p>
            <p>This seems to be a nice feature, and there's even a tool available
            that offers that feature for Windows 7: <a href="http://aura.codeplex.com/">Aura</a>.</p>
            <p>But there are some things about Aura that bother me, so I hacked together
            my own tool which offers that feature.</p>
            <p>Unlike Aura, AAClr is written in plain C++ and doesn't 
            use the .NET framework. For tools that are supposed to be started
            automatically on logon, this ensures that the whole startup time
            doesn't increase by several seconds.</p>
            <p>AAClr also detects changes in wallpapers by catching events
            from the system and doesn't use timers that access the wallpaper file
            several times a second (like Aura does). That means that AAClr is idle
            most of the time and only wakes up when necessary.</p>
            <p>And about resource usage: AAClr uses less than 2MB of 
            private bytes - I think that's not too much.</p>
            <p>A compiled executable can be found on the 
            <a href="http://code.google.com/p/stexbar/downloads/list">download page</a>.</p>

            <p>I hope you like the new design of this tools site. While the old
               design wasn't too bad, I didn't really like it from the beginning.</p>
            <p>The new design should be easier to navigate and to find the tools
               you need.</p>
