            <h2><a href="#">MailNoter</a></h2>
            $ADSENSE_TOP$
            <p>MailNoter is a small tool to help gathering notes from various
            applications, but specifically from browsers.</p>
            <p>There are many tools and applications out there which help to
            keep a repository of personal notes, and even though some of them
            are very good at what they do, they all either use a proprietary
            format to store the notes (what would happen to my notes if the
            application isn't supported anymore and stops working on future OS
            versions?), only store notes as plain text, require non WYSIWYG
            input (e.g., Wikis), don't allow attachments, don't work if
            there's no network access, or are just plain ugly.</p>
            So I'm keeping my notes in my email account:
            <ul>
                <li>open storage format</li>
                <li>available from different computers and OS</li>
                <li>works offline</li>
                <li>usable with any email client</li>
                <li>usable through a web browser (no need to install anything if I'm at a place where I can't just install apps)</li>
                <li>easily searchable (either through the web interface (did I mention I'm using Gmail?)), through desktop search engines or the email client itself</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            And with Gmail, I can add tags to my notes very easily, which
            makes searching them even easier.
            <p>So how does MailNoter help here? (Please don't complain about
            the name: I had to choose something that isn't used by some
            other application, and "MailNoter" returned exactly two hits in
            Google: both because of a typo).</p>
            Without MailNoter, if I want to create a note from a part of
            a website or code snipped in the IDE, I had to:
            <ol>
                <li>create a new mail</li>
                <li>go back to the browser/IDE/whateverApplication</li>
                <li>select the part I want to keep as a note</li>
                <li>hit Ctrl-C to copy it to the clipboard</li>
                <li>go back to the new email I started</li>
                <li>paste the text in</li>
                <li>enter a meaningful subject for the email</li>
                <li>enter the "To:" address</li>
                <li>hit "Send"</li>
            </ol>
            with MailNoter however:
            <ol>
                <li>select the text in the browser/IDE/whateverApplication</li>
                <li>hit the hotkey (e.g., Win+PrintScreen)</li>
                <li>hit "Send"</li>
            </ol>
            MailNoter, when the hotkey is pressed, automatically copies the
            selected text into a new email, fills in the "To:" address and
            also fills in the email subject automatically. No need to manually
            copy/paste, create new email, fill in the same stuff over and over again.
            <p>Another nice feature of MailNoter: selecting files in Explorer
            and hitting the hotkey will create a new email, with the selected
            files already added as an attachment. Image files are not added as
            an attachment though, they're added inline.</p>
            <p>So, as I said: it's a small tool which doesn't do much. But
            it helps me with gathering my notes.</p>
            <p>You can get it from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mailnoter/downloads/list">download page</a>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="#">Setup</a></h3>
            $ADSENSE_INPAGE$
            <p>After downloading MailNoter, unzip the executable file. After
            a doubleclick, you will see a new icon in the system tray:
            <br>
            <img src="img/mailnoter/systrayIcon.png" alt="Tray Icon" width="21" height="23"/>
            <br>
            A right-click on that icon shows a context menu:
            <br>
            <img src="img/mailnoter/contextmenu.png" alt="Context menu" width="134" height="82"/>
            <br>
            A click on the "options" entry brings up the configuration dialog:
            <br>
            <a class="fancybox" data-fancybox-group="gallery" href="img/mailnoter/optionsDialog.png" title="Options dialog">
                <img src="img/mailnoter/optionsDialog-small.png" alt="Options dialog" width="148" height="89"/>
            </a>
            <br>
            Here you can set the hotkey, the "from" address (most email clients
            will ignore that, so you can leave that empty) and of course the
            "To:" address. You should enter here your own email address.
            Hint: some email providers allow you to add custom parts to your
            address, for example <em>myemailaddress+notes@example.com</em>.
            The part after the <em>+</em> is then ignored, but you can use that
            to set up a filter to automatically move mails arriving at that
            address to a "notes" folder in your email account.</p>
            <p>You can also set here that MailNoter automatically starts when
            you log in to your workstation.</p>
            <p>You can also modify the look of the "appendix" which is added
            automatically for html content, which by default is a one row
            table containing the source URL.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="#">Email client</a></h3>
            <p>For MailNoter to work, you must have an email client installed
            which supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messaging_Application_Programming_Interface">Simple MAPI</a>.
            Most email clients support that, but you might have to set your
            email client as the "default" email client first.</p>
            <p>Also, MAPI was created before HTML mails existed, so there is
            no way to tell an email client that it should use HTML mails. To
            avoid the email client use plain text instead of HTML mails, you
            have to configure your client to create HTML mails by default, not
            text mails. But that's the default for most email clients anyway.</p>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="#">Capture content</a></h3>
            <p>After you've set everything up and MailNoter is running, you
            can start capturing content. For example, go to a website with your
            preferred browser, select an interesting part of the page, hit the
            hotkey and see MailNoter open a new email for you with your
            default email client:
            <br>
            <a class="fancybox" data-fancybox-group="gallery" href="img/mailnoter/capturingWeb.png" title="Capturing the web">
                <img src="img/mailnoter/capturingWeb-small.png" alt="Capturing the web" width="257" height="193"/>
            </a>
            </p>
