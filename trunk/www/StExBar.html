		<h2><a href="#">StExBar : The ultimate tool for Windows Explorer</a></h2>
		$ADSENSE_TOP$

		<div class="storycontent">
			<p>or: what Microsoft forgot to implement in the explorer.</p>
			<p>Go to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/stexbar/downloads/list">download page</a>.</p>
			<p>The StExBar provides many useful commands for your everyday use
			of Windows explorer. And you can add as many custom commands on
			your own as you like.</p>
			<a href="img/StExBar.png" rel="lightbox[stexbar]"><img src="img/StExBar-small.png" alt="StExBar screenshot" /></a>
			<p>The commands are not just available from the toolbar, but also
			via hotkeys and via a context menu!</p>
			<p>Have you ever needed to open a console window while you were
			using the explorer? And to have that console already set to the
			directory you're showing in explorer right now? Well, StExBar
			provides that with one simple mouseclick. There's also a hotkey
			defined for this: simply press <em>Ctrl-M</em> to open the console.</p>
			<p>A "lightweight" console is also available. Simply enter the
			command you like to execute into the edit box on the right of the
			StExBar and hit enter. The command will be executed in the
			system console.</p>
			<p>Have you ever needed to have the name or full path of one or
			more files in another application? <em>Ctrl-C</em> doesn't work
			here, that won't copy the file path but the file itself. StExBar
			comes to the rescue. It provides two commands, one to copy all
			selected file/foldernames to the clipboard, the other copies the
			whole paths of all selected items. To make it even more easier to
			use this, a hotkey is defined <em>Ctrl-Shift-C</em> which copies
			the selected paths.</p>
			<a href="img/StEx-newfolder.png" rel="lightbox[stexbar]"><img src="img/StEx-newfolder-small.png" alt="StExBar new folder command" /></a>.
			<p>Creating new folders is a common task in explorer. But to
			actually do that, you have to right-click on a folder background,
			choose "New" from the context menu, wait until the submenu finally
			appears, then choose "Folder" from that submenu. Not anymore!
			StExBar provides you the same with one easy click. Or even faster
			with the assigned hotkey: just press <em>Ctrl-Shift-N</em> and you
			have a new folder created in the current directory.</p>
			<a href="img/StEx-rename.png" rel="lightbox[stexbar]"><img src="img/StEx-rename-small.png" alt="StExBar rename dialog" /></a>.
			<p>StExBar can also help you renaming multiple files at once.
			It uses Regular Expression strings to do so.</p>
			<p>You can add your own commands to the StExBar and define hotkeys for them.</p>
			<a href="img/StEx-options.png" rel="lightbox[stexbar]"><img src="img/StEx-options-small.png" alt="StExBar Options" /></a>.
			<p>You can start your configured tools and the internal console
			command in <b>elevated</b> mode by holding down the left WIN key.
			This works for clicking on the toolbar button as well as when you
			execute the hotkey.</p>

		<h2><a href="#">Installation</a></h2>

		$ADSENSE_INPAGE$
		<div class="storycontent">
			<p>Installation is easy, just run the msi installer:
			<a href="http://stexbar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/www/img/installer.png" rel="lightbox[stexbar]"><img src="img/installer-small.png" alt="StExBar installer" /></a>.
			</p>
			<p>After installing, the StExBar is ready:
				<ol>
					<li>open an explorer window</li>
					<li>open the menu "View->Toolbars" (note: on vista, you have to either activate the menu first, or hit the ALT key)</li>
					<li>chose "StExBar" from the list</li>
					<li>you may want to adjust the size and position of the StExBar. To do that, you have to first unlock the toolbars with the menu "View->Toolbars->Lock the Toolbars"</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>After that, the StExBar is ready:
			<a href="http://stexbar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/www/img/vistaexplorer.png" rel="lightbox[stexbar]"><img src="img/vistaexplorer-small.png" alt="Vista explorer" /></a>.
			</p>
			<p>Note: restarting should not be necessary (only close all explorer windows).
			But if you don't see the StExBar listed in the Toolbars menu, it's most
			likely because Windows caches the installed toolbars:
			<br/>
			Delete the following two registry keys to clear the cache (the registry
			keys will be automatically recreated):
			<br/>
			HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Discardable\PostSetup\Component Categories\{00021493-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}\Enum
			<br/>
			HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Discardable\PostSetup\Component Categories\{00021494-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}\Enum
			</p>
			<p>If the StExBar is still not showing properly, go to <em>Internet
			Options/Advanced/Browsing</em> and there check
			<em>Enable third-party browser extensions</em>.
			</p>

		<h2><a href="#">Example commands</a></h2>

		<div class="storycontent">
			<p>While the StExBar already has some useful commands built in,
			you might want to add commands of your own.</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>Open selected file in Editor</dt>
				<dd><p>While for many file types like *.txt a doubleclick will
				open the file in the editor, many file types have their own
				doubleclick action and won't open the file in an editor. Here's
				my custom command to open any file in the Windows editor by
				simply hitting Ctrl-E:
				<a href="http://stexbar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/www/img/editor.png" rel="lightbox[stexbar]"><img src="img/editor-small.png" alt="Open in Editor command" /></a>.
				</p></dd>

				<dt>Toggle the readonly attribute</dt>
				<dd><p>To toggle the readonly attribute of selected files, we
				have to write a small script. The script is in the contrib
				folder of our sourcecode, which you can find
				<a href="http://stexbar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/StExBar/contrib/">here</a>.
				The file is called "attrib.js".</p>
				<p>
				<a href="http://stexbar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/www/img/attrib.png" rel="lightbox[stexbar]"><img src="img/attrib-small.png" alt="toggle readonly attribute" /></a>.

				</dd>

		<h2><a href="#">Contribute</a></h2>

		<div class="storycontent">
			<p>if you have your own commands and scripts which you think might
			be useful to others, then please share them!</p>
			<p>Just file an issue in our
			<a href="http://code.google.com/p/stexbar/issues/list?q=label:command">issue tracker</a> and
			attach your script there. Don't forget to mention what your
			script or command does.</p>
			<p>We will put your scripts in our contrib folder for others to use.
			It would be good if you add some comments at the top of your
			scripts which explain what it does and how to use it.</p>
