			<p>EvImSync is a small tool to synchronize
			<a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a> notebooks with a
			<a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/">GMail</a> account.
			Notes in Evernote are uploaded to your GMail account as emails, and
			emails in GMail are imported to Evernote notebooks as notes.
			</p>

			<p>
			EvImSync requires the .NET framework 4. You can get this via Windows
			update or directly from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9cfb2d51-5ff4-4491-b0e5-b386f32c0992&amp;displaylang=en">here</a>.
			</p>
			<h3>Details: how it works</h3>
			<p>
			EvImSync uses the Evernote script engine <code>ENScript.exe</code>
			to import and export notes. These notes are parsed and then compared
			to emails in your GMail account using the IMAP protocol. This requires
			that you have enabled IMAP in your GMail settings:
			</p>
			<img src="img/GMail-IMAP.png" alt="GMail-IMAP" width="444" height="66" />
			<p>
			You can sync one notebook with one folder in a GMail account. EvImSync
			allows you to sync as many notebooks and GMail folders as you like.
			</p>
			<h3>Limitations</h3>
			<p>
			Due to limitations both in the IMAP protocol, the Evernote scripting
			engine and the available documentation, the synchronization is not
			perfect. Some things simply can't be done by EvImSync.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Notes in Evernote are not deleted: if you delete an email
				in GMail, that deletion is not reflected in Evernote. ENScript
				doesn't have a command to delete a specific note. Instead, EvImSync
				uploads the note from Evernote again to GMail. That means that
				if you want to delete a note, you must do that in Evernote, not
				in your GMail account. Notes that are deleted in Evernote get
				moved to the folder "evernote trash" in your GMail account
				from where you can remove them permanently if you like.</li>
				<li>Tag changes in GMail are not reflected in Evernote: Again,
				ENScript doesn't have a command to do that. However, if you have
				a new email that's not already synced the Evernote you can use
				GMail to add the tags you like. New emails are properly imported
				to Evernote with all the GMail tags you have set.<br/>
				Synching tags in the other direction works ok: If you change
				tags in Evernote, those changes are properly reflected in your
				GMail account.</li>
				<li>Source URLs are not synched: Source URLs from Evernote are
				not stored in GMail, but of course left as is in the Evernote notes.</li>
				<li>Ink notes: Evernote Ink notes are not shown in GMail. The
				format of those notes is not documented, so I can't convert them
				to images or something like that which would properly be shown
				in an email. Instead, such notes are converted to an email
				attachment. Synching those works, but as mentioned you won't
				be able to actually see them in GMail.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Installation</h3>
			<p>EvImSync does not require installation. It can be run from any
			place. Just doubleclick on the file to run it.</p>
			<p>By default, EvImSync stores its configuration in the <code>%APPDATA%</code>
			folder. However if you want to use EvImSync on an USB-stick, rename
			the exe file to <code>EvImSyncPortable.exe</code>: this will force
			EvImSync to store its configuration in the same directory as it was
			started from.</p>
			<h3>Configuration</h3>
			<p>
			EvImSync needs to know which GMail folder it has to sync with which
			of your notebooks in Evernote. To do that, you have to enter this
			information in the configuration dialog. You can get to that dialog
			via the <code>File->Configuration</code> menu.
			</p>
			<img src="img/evimsync-configuration.png" alt="configuration" width="473" height="404" />
			<br/>
			<ul>
				<li><code>Path to ENScript.exe</code>: in case EvImSync can not
				determine that path automatically, you have to set it yourself.
				That tool should be in the folder where you've installed Evernote.</li>
				<li><code>Evernote Notebook</code>: the name of the notebook
				you want to sync.</li>
				<li><code>Server</code>: the domain name of the GMail imap server.
				Usually that's <code>imap.gmail.com</code>.</li>
				<li><code>Username/Password</code>: your GMail username and
				password.</li>
				<li><code>Base Folder</code>: the IMAP folder name where you want
				your notes to be put under. EvImSync requires that all notes
				be stored in a subfolder. I usually use <em>Notes</em> or the
				name of the Evernote notebook for that name.</li>
			</ul>
			After you've set that information, click on the <em>Set Pair</em>
			button to store the GMail/Notebook pair. You can configure as many
			pairs as you like.
			<br/><br/>
			<h3>Synching</h3>
			<p>
			If you've set up at least one sync pair, just click on the <em>Start Sync</em>
			button to start the synchronization. Depending on how many notes/emails
			you have, this might take a while though.
			</p>

			<h3>Report problems</h3>
			<p>
			In case you encounter a bug or some other problem, please file an
			issue in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/evimsync/issues/list">issue tracker</a>.
			If EvImSync has problems with the encoding of emails, please save
			the email as an <code>eml</code> and attach it to the issue. Otherwise
			filing the issue is useless since I won't be able to reproduce the
			problem and therefore won't be able to fix it.
			</p>
