        <!--$ADSENSE_TOP$-->
        <p>
            Windows 8 has a new feature where the Aero colors can be
            <a href="http://www.withinwindows.com/2011/04/06/windows-8-secrets-aero-auto-colorization/">
            automatically adjusted according to the selected wallpaper</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This seems to be a nice feature, and there's even a tool available
            that offers that feature for Windows 7: <a href="http://aura.codeplex.com/">Aura</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            But there are some things about Aura that bother me, so I hacked
            together my own tool which offers that feature.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike Aura, AAClr is written in plain C++ and doesn't use the .NET
            framework. For tools that are supposed to be started automatically
            on logon, this ensures that the whole startup time doesn't increase
            by several seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
            AAClr also detects changes in wallpapers by catching events from
            the system and doesn't use timers that access the wallpaper file
            several times a second (like Aura does). That means that AAClr is
            idle most of the time and only wakes up when necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            And about resource usage: AAClr uses less than 2MB of private
            bytes - I think that's not too much.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've put the AAClr source code into the <a href="StExBar.html">StExBar</a>
            repository since it's too small to justify creating its own project for it.
            You can browse the source code <a href="http://code.google.com/p/stexbar/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FMisc%2FAAClr">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            A compiled executable can be found on the
            <a href="http://code.google.com/p/stexbar/downloads/list">download page</a>.
