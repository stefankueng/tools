		<div class="storycontent">
			<p>Windows 8 has a new feature where the Aero colors can be
			<a href="http://www.withinwindows.com/2011/04/06/windows-8-secrets-aero-auto-colorization/">
			automatically adjusted according to the selected wallpaper</a>.</p>
			<p>This seems to be a nice feature, and there's even a tool available
			that offers that feature for Windows 7: <a href="http://aura.codeplex.com/">Aura</a>.</p>
			<p>But there are some things about Aura that bother me, so I hacked together
			my own tool which offers that feature.</p>
			<p>Unlike Aura, AAClr is written in plain C++ and doesn't
			use the .NET framework. For tools that are supposed to be started
			automatically on logon, this ensures that the whole startup time
			doesn't increase by several seconds.</p>
			<p>AAClr also detects changes in wallpapers by catching events
			from the system and doesn't use timers that access the wallpaper file
			several times a second (like Aura does). That means that AAClr is idle
			most of the time and only wakes up when necessary.</p>
			<p>And about resource usage: AAClr uses less than 2MB of
			private bytes - I think that's not too much.</p>

		<div class="storycontent">
			<p>I've put the AAClr sourcecode into the <a href="StExBar.html">StExBar</a>
			repository since it's too small to justify creating its own project
			for it. You can browse the source code
			<a href="http://code.google.com/p/stexbar/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FMisc%2FAAClr">here</a>.</p>
			<p>A compiled executable can be found on the
			<a href="http://code.google.com/p/stexbar/downloads/list">download page</a>.</p>
