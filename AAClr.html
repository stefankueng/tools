For tools that are supposed to be started automatically on logon, this ensures that the whole startup time doesn't increase by several seconds.<p>AAClr also detects changes in wallpapers by catching events from the system and doesn't use timers that access the wallpaper file several times a second (like Aura does). That means that AAClr is idle most of the time and only wakes up when necessary.<p>And about resource usage: AAClr uses less than 2MB of private bytes - I think that's not too much.<p>I've put the AAClr source code into the <a href=/StExBar.html>StExBar</a> repository since it's too small to justify creating its own project for it. You can browse the source code <a href=https://sourceforge.net/p/stefanstools/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/Misc/AAClr/ >here</a>.<p>A compiled executable can be found on the <a href=https://sourceforge.net/projects/stefanstools/files/AAClr/ >download page</a>.</div></div><footer class=main-sprite><ul><li><a href=https://sourceforge.net/projects/stefanstools><img alt="SourceForge logo" class=sf-logo height=15 src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" title="SourceForge Project" width=80></a><li>• © <a href=/about.html>Stefan Küng</a></ul><p>Site last updated: Tuesday, March 27th, 2018, 12:15:43 GMT+0200</footer><script async src=js/pack.02ce263d.js></script>
