#summary How to build stexbar in VS 2008.

= Pre-requisites =
  * Visual Studio 2008
  * [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=D466226B-8DAB-445F-A7B4-448B326C48E7&displaylang=en Visual C++ 2008 Feature Pack] ( Microsoft's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_Report_1 TR1] implementation )
  * [http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads Subversion] ( for SubWCRev.exe which generates version.h with Subversion Revision information )
  * [http://wix.sourceforge.net/ Windows Installer XML toolset] ( for installer package )
  * [http://nant.sourceforge.net/ nant] ( optional - enables auto running SubWCRev and generating installer package )

= Details =

  * Install pre-requistes
  * If not using nant, manually run __SubWCRev.exe . src/version.in src/version.h__ from the solution directory
  * Make sure you don't have any old VS2005 include directories defined in Tools->Options->Projects and Solutions->VC++ Directories as VS2008 may try to read headers from there instead of it's own directories. New VS2008 features are used which require the VS2008 versions of the headers and libraries.
  * Then everything should build without error
