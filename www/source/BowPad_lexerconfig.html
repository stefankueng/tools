    <h2>User configurable color styles</h2>

    <p>
        While BowPad as a huge list of ready available lexers and coloring styles which you can use
        to get the proper coloring for your files, it might be necessary to
        create a new one that suits your own files.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, you might have your own XML based file format, which has
        custom keywords and attributes which you want to have colored
        separately. The default XML style of course doesn't know about your
        own keywords and attributes, so you need to configure your own styling
        setup.
    </p>
    <p>
        We're going through creating a custom style setup for an XML based language
        as an example. You should be able to use this as a base in case you need
        another style as the base for your customization.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have your custom lexer styling file done, you can drag and drop
        that file over the BowPad window: BowPad will ask whether
        you want to edit the file or import it. For this to work, the file
        needs to have the extension set to <code>*.bplex</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>Start</h3>
    <p>
        First, get the template for a custom lexer styling from
        <a href="template.bplex">here</a>. Open the file in BowPad for editing. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You can see several sections in that file. First replace all <code>YourLanguage</code>
        strings with the name of your own file language, e.g. <code>myXML</code>.
        Then set the file extensions of your own files, so BowPad knows to apply
        your custom styling for these files.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next you can define your own keywords the lexer should use. As a starting
        point, have a look at the styling file BowPad uses for all the available
        lexers <a href="https://github.com/stefankueng/BowPad/blob/main/src/res/Properties.ini">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you can see from the <code>Properties.ini</code> file, different lexers
        have different keywords set. Under the section <code>[lang_Vxml]</code>
        you can see that BowPad has two keyword sets set up. So how do you know
        how many keyword sets a lexer provides? Unfortunately, that's not quite easy:
        you have to actually check the sourcecode of the lexer. In our case,
        the lexer that provides XML styling is the html-lexer, which you can find
        <a href="https://github.com/stefankueng/BowPad/blob/main/ext/scintilla/lexers/LexHTML.cxx">here</a>.
        The other lexers you might want to use are listed <a href="https://github.com/stefankueng/BowPad/blob/main/ext/scintilla/lexers">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The html lexer uses 7 keyword sets. But for styling xml files, only the first
        two are used, and even the second one is only used in special situations.
        You can get some information by looking at the <code>htmlWordListDesc</code>
        string in the file <code>LexHTML.cxx</code>.
        So you have to add your own XML elements and attribute names in the first
        keyword set.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other options under the <code>[lang_myXML]</code> section are:
        <dl>
            <dt>CommentLine</dt>
            <dd>Configures which chars are used to mark a line comment.
            in many programming languages that would be <code>//</code>.
            </dd>
            
            <dt>CommentLineAtStart</dt>
            <dd>0 if the comment line can start anywhere on a line, 1 if such
            comments must start at the beginning of a line.</dd>
            
            <dt>CommentStreamStart/CommentStreamEnd</dt>
            <dd>Marks the inline comment chars. For example <code>/*</code>
            and <code>*/</code></dd>
            
            <dt>FunctionRegex</dt>
            <dd>A regular expression which captures function names</dd>
            
            <dt>UserFunctions</dt>
            <dd>if not zero, the function regex is used to add the found
            function names to the keywords for styling</dd>
        </dl>
    </p>
    <p>
        So for an XML based language, you would specify
        <pre class="prettyprint">
CommentStreamStart=&lt;!--
CommentStreamEnd=--&gt;</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        And at last, under the section <code>[Lexer_myXML]</code> we can specify
        the colors to use. But first, you need to specify here which lexer
        to use. For the XML lexer, the value to use would be <code>5</code>,
        so you have to specify <code>Lexer=5</code> there.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can find the value for the lexer in Scintillas <a href="https://github.com/stefankueng/BowPad/blob/main/ext/scintilla/include/SciLexer.h">SciLexer.h</a>
        file. The value for <code>SCLEX_XML</code> is defined as 5, so that's the
        value we have to use.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each lexer has a specific amount of color styles. They're numbered from
        0-n. Since the XML lexer is basically the HTML lexer, look for <code>SCE_HTML_</code>
        in the <a href="https://github.com/stefankueng/BowPad/blob/main/ext/scintilla/include/SciLexer.h">SciLexer.h</a>
        file.
    </p>
    <p>
        The format for the coloring style is:<br>
        <code>StyleN=Name;Foregroundcolor;Backgroundcolor;fontname;fontstyle;fontsize</code><br>
        The colors are RGB values in HEX, and the font style is a combination of the following values:<br>
        0 = none<br>
        1 = bold<br>
        2 = italic<br>
        4 = underlined<br>
        leave the values empty if you want to use the default.
    </p>


    <h3>Simple lexer</h3>
    <p>
        BowPad also has a simple lexer, which can be used if none of the language specific
        lexers fit your file format.
    </p>
    <p>
        The simple lexer doesn't do much, but it has 9 keyword sets, colors numbers, strings
        and comments. This means while the lexer does not know anything about your file
        format, you can still use the keyword sets to color statements, attributes, ...
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if you specify <code>if for else while return</code> for a keyword set,
        you'll get coloring for such statements even though the lexer doesn't know about which
        of the words are such statements.
    </p>

        Here's a template for a custom style using the simple lexer:

            <dd>1 to have the keyword set behave case-sensitive.
            Note: if not set or set to 0 (case-insensitive), the keywords must

            <dt>Prop_markedWords1</dt>
            <dd>a char or string that marks a special word which is colored separately.
            For example you can mark all words that start with a <code>$</code> separately,
            or if you specify e.g. <code>Gtk_</code> every word that starts with that
            will be colored as well.</dd>
