    <h2>CryptSync</h2>

    <p>
    CryptSync is a small utility that synchronizes two folders
    while encrypting the contents in one folder. That means one
    of the two folders has all files unencrypted (the files
    you work with) and the other folder has all the files
    encrypted.</p>
    <p>
    The synchronization works both ways: a change in one folder
    gets synchronized to the other folder. If a file is added
    or modified in the unencrypted folder, it gets encrypted.
    If a file is added or modified in the encrypted folder, it
    gets decrypted to the other folder.

    This is best used together with cloud storage tools like
    <a href="https://OneDrive.live.com/">OneDrive</a>,
    <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">DropBox</a> or
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you want to use such cloud storage for backups, it's a good
    idea to keep your private data really private. That means
    only uploading encrypted files to make sure no one else
    can access your data. Because even if the companies behind
    the cloud storage guarantee your privacy, it's always
    possible that your account gets hacked: so make sure you
    use a different password to encrypt the data with CryptSync
    than you use to login to your cloud storage provider!
    </p>
    <p>
    If you want to backup and encrypt your files to more than
    one cloud storage (just to be safe), you can do that as well:
    just set up two sync pairs with the original folder being
    the same for both pairs.
    </p>
    <p>
    Of course, you can use CryptSync for backups to an external drive
    as well. You can even use CryptSync from the command line to trigger
    your encrypted backups.
    </p>
    <p>
    CryptSync works by synchronizing folder pairs. One folder
    is called the <em>original</em> folder: that's where
    your unencrypted files are stored and where you work
    with your files. The second folder of such a pair is the
    <em>encrypted</em> folder which is where the files
    get copied from the original folder and encrypted.
    The encrypted folder is usually located somewhere inside
    your cloud storage sync folder.
    </p>
    <p>
    The encryption is done using the <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html">LZMA SDK</a>,
    which also compress them at the same time. That means you
    not only get encryption but also compression for free,
    which reduces the storage space you use in the cloud or the backup space
    on your external harddrive.</p>
    <p>
    That also means that if you ever need to access your encrypted
    files directly from the cloud, you can save them locally
    and just open them with 7-Zip or any other compression tool.
    Of course you will then be asked to provide the password you used
    with CryptSync to open that file.
    </p>
    <p>
    Optionally the encryption can be done using <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a>.
    Please note that when using this option, the encrypted files can be larger
    than the original files and use up more space on your cloud drive.
    </p>
    <p>
    When you first start CryptSync, the main dialog is shown
    where you have to set up the folders to synchronize.

    </a>
    <p>
    To add a folder pair, click on the button and then enter
    the paths to both folders. Then enter the password that
    will be used to encrypt and decrypt your files.
    </p>

    </a>
    <p>
    Since even filenames can reveal private information, you can
    have CryptSync also encrypt the filenames. But remember
    that if you activate this option, you won't be able to
    tell what file is what if you ever need to access them
    from your cloud storage providers web interface.
    Names of subfolders are encrypted as well.
    </p>
    <section class="important">
    <h2>Long paths</h2>
    <p>When encrypting the file and folder names without the new filename encryptions,
    you have to make sure that the original file and folder names
    are not longer than about 120 characters. Because
    encrypting those names approximately doubles their length,
    and Windows has a limit of 255 chars per file or folder name.</p>
    </section>
    <p>The main dialog has three buttons to dismiss it:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Run in background</dt>
        <dd>This is the default. CryptSync will run in the background
        and monitor all the folder pairs for changes. Once it
        detects a change, it will automatically synchronize that
        change immediately. This is also the only way to detect
        deletions of files.</dd>
        <dt>Sync files and exit</dt>
        <dd>This will synchronize all folder pairs while showing
        you the progress of the synchronization. Once all folders
        are synchronized and up to date, CryptSync will exit
        and not run in the background.</dd>
        <dt>Exit</dt>
        <dd>Closes the dialog and quits CryptSync. It will not
        keep running in the background.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3 id="commands">Command Line Options</h3>
